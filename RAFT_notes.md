# 1 Introduction
Consus algorithms: allow a collection of machines to work as a coherent group that can survive the failures of some of its members

Raft's novel features:
1. Strong leader
   - e.g. log entries only flow from lead to other servers
2. Leader election 
   - use randomized timers to elect leaders, attached to heartbeats
3. Membership changes:
   - a new joint consensus approach, majorities of two different config overlap

# 2 Replicated state machines
used to solve a variety of fault tolerance problems in distributed system
- e.g. GFS

# 3 What's wrong with Paxos
two significant drawbacks:
1. exceptionally difficult to understand
2. no good foundation for building practical implementations

# 4 Designing for understandability

# 5 The Raft consensus algorithm
a distinguished leader, complete responsible for managing the replicated log, who do:
1. accept log entries from clients
2. replicate log entries to other servers
3. tell servers when it is safe to apply log entries to their state machines

Raft decomposes the consensus problem into three subproblems
1. Leader election(5.2)
2. Log replication(5.3)
3. Safety(5.4, 5.2)
